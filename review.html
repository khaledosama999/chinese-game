                        "review": "Ok, let's be honest. Clash Royle used to be one of the best mobile games but now, you can't play normally without spending your money on it. I think that is very unfair to the OG players (I played 3-4 years with the game too) and they made the game very bizarre and P2W. The most of the new features (like books and wild cards) are very strange and I feel like I'm not playing the good, old Clash Royale. It can happen, that this is a good game but not that good, when we played it for the 1st time.",

I've almost never had glitches, I can play with my old babysitter, and once with a skin pack I even scared her to think that Herobrine was in our world! The only bad thing is I want 1.17 on this, because it's on Java, and that's on my computer. So far I'm writing this on my phone. But anyways it's a great game and it's so adventurous. But you really messed up on the creeper, notch.",

There are never glitches, bugs, honestly wow. I'm impressed. (Also if you become really into the game, you will start to rage whenever you lose) The graphics are amazing also! And the dev's always make sure there are zero hackers!",

Wow. I have NEVER seen a greater deal then that. Thank you FDG entertainment. There are 75 levels (hoping for a sixth chapter) so will you bump it up to 90? If you will, thank you. I wish I could rate 6 stars because of all the good things you've done. I wish you the best of luck with chapter 6. Thanks for all that you've done to the app",

They are always adding extra little games inside to win diamonds or free games . Thank you for that and for having so many holiday games too. It's not suppose to be super easy it's challenging and fun !!! I've never spent any $$$ Lots of fun",

Obviously they need to make money that's the point around F2P you guys need to understand. It's going to be grindy. As far as bugs go I have yet, since the games been out, seen any bugs. connection wise with battles, either don't play them or be in an area that's not 1 bar 🤷, best connection is going to win until carrier services are good EVERYWHERE.",

You can also buy some things. The car were also good. But sometimes it is really fast and I can't control it. This game is really good 😊",

I'm currently TH11 and was dreading the walls of being 3 million each but now only cost 2 million each and down even more with Gold pass taking it down to 1.6 million, everything is cheaper, Heroes, Troops, Buildings. And all in all I love this game, sure it takes time but it took me 10 months to max TH10 and I enjoyed every second of it. Keep it up Supercell love all your games.",

The animation is great and the game is unique. Been playing since 2014. The game changed but the change is ok. But I miss the jelly lab and when you can swap costumes while asking you to revive. Still a great game. Its addicting and I definitely recommend this to play.",

In the menu options there are missions, and these missions are whats really fun about the game. You will get bored if you just go around and do tricks, but the missions are where it's at. Secondly, everyone complaining that the controls are hard or glitchy honestly just has to play the game longer. You will get used to how the board handles, and eventually you can precisely land tricks how you want. Great game",

Normally I wouldn't mind this, but when I got back in, all the quests I had already done, I needed to do again. But besides that, it's a really funny game and I definitely recommend this if your bored or if you need a good laugh.",

But when fighting burtrum in chapter 4 it's really laggy, can you fix that if you could, maybe it's just my phone. Also when fighting brute boris in the same chapter the first time I died I was at the light at the end of the inky tunnel and it didnt let me respawn, but I tried it again and it worked fine and I respawned in the brute boris room. Can you just fix those 2 glitches please? I would recommend this game to everyone",

One gripe I have, but it is very hilarious when it happens, is when i continue a saved daily challenge, the map data doesn't line up, so I can be on Balanced that day then the next, the monkeys are places the same but the map is on Cubism. I don't really mind it though. It just makes for a good laugh. Another thing I think could be changed is the price for the heroes.
